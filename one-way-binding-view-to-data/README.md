# Description

This example illustrates the use of a one-way data binding **from view to data**.

Bindings from view to data relate to events (triggered by the user while interacting with the UI).
The list of available events can be found here: [HTML DOM Events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp). 

> If you use the Dart plugin for JetBrain editors, you get a list of all available events while you edit the HTML code of a component template.
